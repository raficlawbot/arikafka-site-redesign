          <h2>About Ari</h2>
          <p>Sports have always been my outlet — the place I felt most alive and in control. I was a three‑sport athlete in high school and played college baseball at Quinnipiac University, learning from legendary mentors like Dick Radatz and Jim Lonborg. Those lessons about the mental game carried me into three seasons in Minor League Baseball with the Seattle Mariners.</p>
          <p>After retiring from pro sports, I earned my MSW and became a licensed social worker. For a decade I supported incarcerated individuals, abuse survivors, addicts, and young adults navigating mental health challenges.</p>
          <p>Today I blend clinical expertise and athletic experience to help teens, athletes, high performers, and couples build confidence, resilience, and stronger connection.</p>
